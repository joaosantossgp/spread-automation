# AGENTS.md

Operational contract for contributors and coding agents.

## Source of truth
- Backlog lives in GitHub Issues.
- Pull requests close task issues, not epics.

## Discovery-first startup
At the start of each executable chat:
- check open tasks in your lane,
- check child tasks received from other lanes,
- check child tasks requested by your lane,
- check open PRs linked to those issues,
- resolve awaiting-consumption before expanding cross-lane scope.

## Mandatory flow
1. Find or create an open task issue before changing versioned files.
2. Ensure required labels exist: kind, status, priority, area, risk, lane.
3. Ensure issue body includes owner, lane, workspace, write-set, and risk.
4. Work in a dedicated worktree and branch.
5. Open a single official PR with Closes #<issue-number> in the body.
6. Complete PR only after required checks are green.
7. Confirm linked issue closure and branch cleanup.

## Branch and worktree
- Branch pattern: <lane>/<issue-number>-<slug>
- Worktree pattern: .claude/worktrees/<lane>/<issue-number>-<slug>/
- Rule: one task, one owner, one branch, one worktree, one PR.

## Parallel work protocol
- Interfaces are additive-only by default during parallel execution.
- Breaking contract changes require a dedicated contract-sensitive task.
- If write-set collision happens across tasks, declare dependency before continuing.

## Child tasks
- If work crosses lane ownership, open formal child tasks.
- Child tasks must include Task mae, Lane solicitante, and Criterio de consumo.
- Parent task remains blocked or awaiting-consumption until requester confirms consumption.

## Risk policy
- safe: isolated write-set
- shared: shared or critical paths, draft PR required
- contract-sensitive: public contract changes, draft PR and compatibility section required

## Completion
A task is complete only when PR is merged and linked issue is closed.

## Safety constraints
- Required checks must stay green for merge completion.
- Never force-remove worktrees without explicit approval.
- Never use destructive Git reset commands.
